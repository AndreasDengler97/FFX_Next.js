Tidus had a very different life before he met sin.

Tidus resides in the Dream Zanarkand. This is a mechanical metropolis that is actually a dream summoned by Yu Yevon, who sought to reproduce Zanarkand and its people as they existed a thousand years ago.

The story begins with Tidus leaving his house to go to his blitzball match at the Zanarkand stadium. He is a popular blitzball player from the metropolis of Zanarkand. His team is named the Zanarkand Abes. His fans are gathered outside of his house and he stops to speak with them for a while. He autographs some blitzballs for fans and flirts with some ladies. The kids beg him to stay and show them some tricks, Tidus tells them he is on his way to a match and makes a promise to play blitzball with them the next day, then he wanders off to his match.

While crossing the bridge the announcer starts to talk about Jecht's disappearance and they showcase his photo on the screen. The tournament held today is in his memory. Tidus is the son of Jecht, who was a legendary blitzball player before he vanished 10 years ago. Tidus rebelled from his father at an early age. He thought his father was an awful person who looked down on and belittled him. Jecht truly loved Tidus tho, his attempts to express his affection failed to connect with him. Tidus' mother loved Jecht with all her heart, often forgetting to give attention to her son and giving it all to he husband instead. After Jecht disappeared she fell into a deep depression and soon passed away. Tidus blamed Jecht for this. With no family left, Tidus just has Blitzball and his fans.

At the entrance of the stadium there is a huge crowd and Tidus has to squeeze thro the crowd. Fans are grabbing at him, he is stopped several time, but eventually he makes it to the door. He looks back one last time and waves to the adoring fans. Tidus gets to relax for a brief moment before the match begins. The music plays and the crowd cheers. Tidus approaches the field, blitzball in hand. The dome fills with water and the match begins.

Since Jecht's disappearance, Auron has looked after Tidus from afar. Auron is a silent and cryptic man who made promises to look after the children of his comrades. Auron watches sin approach the city with a giant tidal wave.

Meanwhile the game goes on as normal. The two teams clash for possession of the blitzball. Tidus tackles an opponent out of the dome and the crowd goes wild.

Auron is on his way to the match, on his way to Tidus, before sin arrives. Everyone in the city, outside of the tournament, is running for their lives as sin absorbs the city within itself. There is no warning and the people watching the game are oblivious to what is going on outside.

The Zanarkand Abes score a point, the team celebrate briefly amongst themselves. They reset the match and the ball goes out of field, Tidus goes for the save while performing his Father's famous Jecht shot. This is when he sees sin, when he sees what the city is running from, what will destroy his home. Sin shoots out multiply blasts, tearing down the few buildings that remain. The whole city is in ruin, there is no hope. The blast shoots Tidus out of the stadium and he holds onto a railing for his life. Many more blasts go off and he loses his grip, he falls down below to the ruble.

Somehow he survives and wakes near the entrance of the stadium. He shakes off the fall and clumsily gets up. Auron stands near the entrance, waiting for him to approach. Tidus is shocked to see him and calls out to him. He asks him what he is doing there and Auron calmly explains he was waiting for him. Tidus is confused, asks what he means, but Auron just walks off and Tidus goes running after him.
