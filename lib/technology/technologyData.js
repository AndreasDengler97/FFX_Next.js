        "Machina was invented over 3000 years ago and became powerful enough to surpass magic. According to the Final Fantasy X Scenario Ultimania, the first development in Spira was brought about by the power of magic. The use of magic depended on individual factors and those who could use magic naturally had an advantage, while those who couldn't were discriminated against. Thus the age of the magic civilizations was an age of inequality. When machina was invented it was revolutionary and did away with the inequalities and spread throughout Spira. Machina developed quickly, and things once thought impossible became an aspect of everyday life. The endless supply of electricity made 'cities that never slept' a reality. Machina was supposed to be an alternative for those who couldn't use magic, but when it surpassed it new problems arose. Some nations possessed outstanding machina technology, while others didn't, and a new age of inequality began.",

        "Pyreflies can crystallize into spheres by reacting to people's feelings and memories and binding them with images and audio. Spheres make use of these properties of pyreflies to make recordings. The raw material for spheres is water that contains a high concentration of pyreflies, gathered from specific locations, such as the Macalania springs. In modern Spira, a sphere camera is a common item to use when recording a sphere, however some spheres have a built-in mechanism for filming, notably when Yuna records her final message to her friends at the Mi'ihen Highroad. During the Eternal Calm, movie spheres became an important part of the lives of many Spirans. Sphere hunting becomes a popular pastime and groups like the Youth League and New Yevon seek spheres documenting Spira's history. Freelance groups, such as the Gullwings and the Leblanc Syndicate, locate spheres for pleasure or profit.",

        "Gil (ギル, Giru?), also translated as GP, Gold, and G, is the currency in all Final Fantasy games. It is acquired throughout each game and used for making various purchases and occasionally used via some abilities, such as Gil Toss. In Final Fantasy X, gil coins come in several colors (and presumably metals), and each bears an image on one side and the value of the coin on the other. In Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy VII, gil takes the form of silver coins with holes through the middle, or gold coins with holes in Final Fantasy V. In Final Fantasy XII, Penelo can briefly be seen holding a pair of coins presumed to be gil, one silver and one gold, with unclear detailed markings on them. This suggests that gil is loosely based on the Japanese yen (円) or ancient Chinese coins, with the Final Fantasy X gil coins appearing very similar to yen coins. The yen, along with other Chinese and Japanese currencies, such as the mon, have holes in some of the coins, a trait dating back to feudal times when coins were carried on string.",

Since hand guns and fire arms are used by the military they are not considered as machina. It is not considered blasphemous to use them. In battle you will face many enemies using these weapons.",
