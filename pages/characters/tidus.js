      <h1>Tidus</h1>
      <p>
        A popular blitzball player from the metropolis of Zanarkand. During a
        match, Tidus is attacked by the monstrous fiend known as Sin. Thrown
        into the unfamiliar world of Spira, he joins the summoner Yuna on her
        journey. Tidas is a cheerful young teenager, the star blitzball player
        of the Zanarkand Abes. He has long resented his father, a renowned
        blitzball player who disappeared during Tidus's youth. Shortly after his
        father's disappearance, Tidus's mother died of heart break, she deeply
        loved Jecht and just completely gave up on everything after he was gone,
        even neglecting her own son. This made Tidus hate his father even more,
        blaming him for his mothers death. Auron was Tiuds's guardian after
        this, watching him from afar. Tidus's quick moves allow him to attack
        even the swiftest of foes with ease.
