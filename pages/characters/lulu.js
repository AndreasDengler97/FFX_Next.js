      <h1>Lulu</h1>
      <p>
        She and Wakka are childhood friends, and she was once engaged to marry
        Wakka's brother, Chappu. Lulu has acted as a summoner's guardian twice
        before, giving her extensive knowledge of the pilgrimage experience. But
        each prior pilgrimage ended in failure and the death of the summoner,
        leaving deep scars in Lulu's heart. Though she is harsh on herself and
        others, Lulu is kind at heart and hides a secret weakness. She even has
        a cute side, using her collection of stuffed animals as weapons. Lulu's
        experience and wisdom are valuable assets to the party. She treats Yuna
        as though she were her younger sister. Although she may seem insensitive
        at times, there are depths to her emotions that only her closest friends
        can understand.
