        Auron is know as the "legendary guardian", having guarded the high
        summoner Braska ten years ago when he defeated Sin. Despite his service
        on that pilgrimage, Auron could not prevent the tragedy that befell
        Braska and Jecht. He also lost his own life, becoming an "unsent" who
        lingered in the world of the living. Auron joins Yuna's party as one of
        her guardians, wagering on the possibility that the children of his old
        friends might discover the truth and tell their own story. The legendary
        guardian who accompanied High Summoner Braska on the pilgrimage to
        defeat Sin ten years ago. Auron guides Yuna and Tidus on their mission
        to vanquish Sin once more. He swings his gigantic sword with such power
        that even the toughest fiends are cut asunder.
