        Under her people's pretense of protecting summoners from killing
        themselves, Rikku unsuccessfully tries to kidnap Yuna. In time, she
        comes to respect Yuna's determination to complete the summoner's
        pilgrimage and joins her party as a guardian. She may seem to have a
        cheerful scatterbrained personality, but like the other Al Bhed, Rikku
        is rational and steadfast, determined to overcome any obstacle in her
        way. Rikku is a young Al Bhed girl with an upbeat and positive
        personality. She dismantles mechanical enemies with ease, and can steal
        items from enemies as well. When Rikku joins the party near the
        Moonflow, her technical expertise allows you to start customizing
        equipment by adding abilities to the open slots on weapons and armor.
