        Though his existence was meant to foster friendship between the Guado
        and human races, it only made him the target of both races' hatred.
        Fearing strife from his people over what they saw as an impure
        abomination, Jyscal had the wife of his retainer, Tromell, take the
        eight-year-old Seymour and his mother out of Guadosalam in the dead of
        night and bring them to the remote island of Baaj to live in exile.When
        he was but ten years old Seymour was brought to Zanarkand where his
        mother intended to become a fayth so her son could use her aeon
        incarnation to win the peoples' love by destroying Sin and bringing the
        Calm. Final Fantasy X Ultimania Omega elaborates that Seymour's mother
        was dying, motivating her desire to become a fayth for her son even
        though she knew of the mechanics of the Final Summoning through Jyscal,
        as the Guado possess their own records that tell of Spira's sealed
        histories in fragments. Jyscal was aware of Seymour and his mother going
        to the Zanarkand Ruins, and privately supported it. Not caring for
        acceptance if it meant losing her, Seymour mourned for his mother and
        didn't use her aeon, Anima, to battle Sin. Seymour returned to Baaj
        alone and spent his remaining childhood in the temple where his
        isolation inspired his nihilistic views on life and death.
