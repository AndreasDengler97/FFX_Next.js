        Tidus reminds Wakka of his late brother Chappu, and Wakka invites him to
        join the team. Wakka has looked after Yuna since she was seven years
        old. Once she becomes a summoner, he joins her pilgrimage as on of her
        guardians. Wakka is a devout follower of the teachings of Yevon, and he
        particularly hates the Al Bhed for opposing those teachings. But he
        changes his prejudices after learning more about them and about the
        truth behind Yevon's teachings. Although he's the captain of the Besaid
        Aurochs blitzball team, Wakka plans to retire from the sport after this
        year's tournament so that he can devote himself entirely as Yuna's
        guardian. His deadly blitzball is especially useful for shooting down
        aerial enemies.
