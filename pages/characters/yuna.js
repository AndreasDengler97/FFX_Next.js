        When her father left for his pilgrimage she was left behind in the city
        she was born, Bevelle. After her father's success she first felt great
        pride, but then realized he would never return, sacrificing his own life
        to bring on the temporary calm. She was only 7 years old when all this
        happened. Shortly after a young Ronso named Kimahri came to become her
        guardian and brought her to a small village called Besaid. There she met
        Wakka and Lulu, who looked after her as their own little sister. When
        she turned 17 she decided to follow in her father's footsteps and
        entered the temple in Besaid to gain her first aeon, Valefor. A summoner
        who is following in the footsteps of her father, the revered high
        summoner Braska. Yuna's tender nature balances her fierce resolve. Like
        her father before her, Yuna seeks the power of the final summoning to
        defeat Sin. At first Yuna is ready to trade her life to bring about a
        temporary calm, but her pilgrimage leads her to discover how the
        teachings of Yevon deceive those they are meant to guide, as well as the
        true nature of the Final Summoning. Armed with this information, she
        resolves to live and reject the endless spiral of death. Yuna is the
        daughter of the high summoner who defeated Sin to bring about the
        "Calm", a time of peace. Yuna embarks on a pilgrimage to obtain the
        final aeon and defeat Sin. To complete her quest, Yuna has enlisted the
        aid of her most trusted friends as her guardians.
