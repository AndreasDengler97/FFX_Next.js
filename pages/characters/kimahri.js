      <h1>Kimahri</h1>
      <p>
        His taciturn nature and leonine appearance makes him hard to approach,
        but in truth Kimahri is thoughtful and affectionate. After the death of
        the high summoner Braska, he brought the young Yuna to Besaid Village
        and watched over her for the next ten years. His horn, the pride of a
        Ronso, was broken by his rival Biran and the resulting shame forced
        Kimahri to flee his hometown of Gagazet. Despite this, he overcomes his
        trauma to protect Yuna on her pilgrimage. A young warrior of the Ronso
        tribe, Kimahri watched over Yuna during her early years. He is devoted
        to Yuna and serves her loyally as a guardian. Kimahri can learn the
        special attacks of enemies with his Lancet ability.
