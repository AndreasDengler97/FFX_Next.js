          alt="Valefor"
        />
        <p>
          An aeon with great wings whose fayth statue is located in Besaid
          Temple. This aerial aeon easily dodges many attacks from the ground.
          Valefor's regular attack is a quick, snatching motion, which is
          enhanced by the aeon's high accuracy. The unique attack is sonic
          wings, and attack that sends a shockwave at one enemy, inflicting
          damage and delaying the enemy's next turn. Because of the delay effect
          and short recovery time, you can often hit enemies repeatedly with
          sonic wings. The Overdrive attack is Energy Ray which fires a
          super-charged beam that explodes underneath all the foes and causes
          non-elemental damage. There is a second secret overdrive for Valefor
          as well. You obtain this all you have to do is return to Besaid and
          speak to a little girl with a dog standing next to the temple. You
          will receive an item that gives Valefor the Overdrive energy blast. If
          the little girl is not in by the temple then look for her in the item
          shop. Energy blast inflicts greater damage at the cost of higher
          recovery time. Once Yuna activates her ultimate weapon, Nirvana, all
          of Valefor's attacks can break the 9999 damage limit.

        <p>
          A demon that holds dominion over fire, with a fayth statue situated in
          Kilika Temple. According to the writing on its statue illustration,
          Ifrit's fayth was a twenty-three year old boy named Edmondo. Ifrit has
          incredibly high strength in exchange for low defense and magic
          defense. He can self heal by casting fire upon himself. His unique
          attack is meteor strike, a non-elemental attack that is hurled at one
          enemy, but has a longer recovery time that his regular attack. This is
          a useful long-range attack. It also penetrates protect spells despite
          being a physical attack. Ifrit's Overdrive is Hellfire, this attack
          encases its foes in a swirling ball of fiery vengeance and detonates
          it for massive damage to all enemies. All of Ifrit's attacks can reach
          the 9999 damage limit when you activate Wakka's legendary weapon,
          World Champion.

          Temple. Ixion can manipulate lightning, an affinity represented by the
          electric motif of is magic circle. Ixion's high defense and magic
          defense attributes make it a good aeon to summon when the party needs
          protections from an attack. Ixion's unique attack is Aerospark, where
          he fires spinning, razor-sharp discs that converge on a single enemy
          and causes non-elemental damage. The attack also negates magical
          effects like protect, shell, reflect, hast, regen and the nul spells.
          His overdrive is Thor's Hammer, which envelopes all enemies in a
          storming vortex, and then disintegrates it. Lightning based elemental
          damage is inflicted against all enemies. Ixion can inflict more thank
          9999 HP damage once you've activated Kimahri's Spirit Lance.

          hands. There are parts made of ice attached to her right arm. This is
          semitransparent and handled the same way as the ice on her chest.
          Diamond Dust sparkles from the edges of her cape and her tail
          accessory. Diamond Dust is a phenomenon that occurs during severe cold
          when water particles freeze in the air, causing them to sparkle and
          shine. The queen of ice is a gorgeous sight to behold and an agile
          attacker. Her unique attack is Heavenly Strike, creating a giant block
          of ice and drops it on an enemy. The attack slightly delays the
          target's next turn in addition to inflicting non-elemental damage and
          the status ailment threaten. Her overdrive is Diamond Dust, freezing
          all enemies in layers of ice, and then destroys everything with a
          leisurely snap of her fingers. All of Shiva's attack can inflict more
          than 9999 HP damage after you've activated Lulu's legendary weapon,
          the Onion Knight.

          teleport spheres in addition to his services. Yojimbo has four unique
          attacks; Daigoro, Kozuka, Wakizashji, and Zanmato yet has not

          temple of Yevon-Baaj. Its fayth is Seymour's mother, and the plate
          around its neck is engraved with her image. Anima is first seen as
          Seymour's chilling aeon, but the party can acquire it by undertaking a
          quest. Return to Baaj Temple from the airship, defeating Geosgaeno,
          and then enter the underwater temple. Find the six hidden items in the

          alt="Magus Sisters"
        />
        <p>
          Three sister aeons whose fayth statue is situated in Remiem Temple.
          Each sister has a different insect motif -- a ladybug for Cindy, the
          eldest; a mantis for the middle child, Sandy; and a hornet for Mindy,
          the youngest. Each of their magic circles reflects those
          characteristics. This trio made a previous appearance in FF4. They can
          be yours to summon by undertaking a side quest. Capture all of the
          enemies in the Mt. Gagazet area, and return to the monster arena to
          get the Blossom Crown. Acquire all the other aeons, including Yojimbo
          and Anima, and return to Remiem Temple in the Calm Lands. Challenge
          and defeat Belgemine's versions of your aeons. After defeating her
          version of Bahamut, she will give you the Flower Scepter. Continue to
          defeat Yojimbo and Anima. Then move to the door in the back and unseal
          it with these two key items. The Magus Sisters are like three separate
          aeons. As such, they are a bit difficult to control. There are verbal
          requests that must be made, and whether or not they grant Yuna's
          wishes depends upon their level of morale. These sisters have 3 unique
          attacks; Camisade, Razzia and Passado. The sisters might perform their
          unique attacks randomly when the "Do what you will" choice is
          selected, or they might do it when Yuna shouts "Go! Go!". Cindy's
          Camisade shoots blades of fire at an enemy, while Sandy's Razzia
          launches her onto her target. Little Mindy's Passado will rapidly fire
          a burst of fifteen stingers at a single enemy. Their overdrive is
          Delta Attack. When the Magus Sisters are all in Overdrive mode at the
          same time, a new command, "Combine Powers!" appears. The sisters will
          join forces and perform one of the most devastating overdrives in the
          entire game.
