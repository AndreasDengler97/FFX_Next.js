## Getting Started

```bash
$npm install                    # installs dependencies
$npm run dev                    # Starts development server
```
  

After cloning the repository input:

`npm install next react react-dom`

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  `npm run dev`
    Starts the development server.

  `npm run build`
    Builds the app for production.

  `npm start`
    Runs the built app in production mode.

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd nextjs-blog
  `npm run dev`# Next.js

<b>GitHub Workflow :</b>
  
Make sure you have the latest code and are in main branch

`git checkout main`
`git pull`

Create a branch for your task

`git checkout -b branchName`, where `branchName` is a unique branch name of your choosing

Make changes, then get ready to push them to GitHub

`git add .`

Give your commit a meaningful message

`git commit -m “message about the code changes”`

Push your code to GitHub

`git push -u origin branchName`

Go to GitHub and create a pull request

Name `Zynkah` as a reviewer
Associate change with a github issue
Address any pull request comments

Once you get an approval, the build passes with green check marks, and preview the app on vercel, merge the pull request into the main branch
Close your github issue
